This project is a simple yet effective command-line tool for encrypting and decrypting images using the XOR bitwise operation. 
The project is designed to demonstrate how basic encryption techniques can be applied to image files without using external libraries, making it a beginner-friendly approach to understanding encryption algorithms 
and file manipulation in Python.


This project includes:
   XOR Encryption: The image data is manipulated at the byte level using the XOR operation with a user-provided key, which is a basic yet effective cryptographic technique.
Two Modes:
1. Encryption Mode: The tool encrypts a selected image and saves the output with a prefixed filename.
2. Decryption Mode: It can decrypt an XOR-encrypted image using the same key, reverting the image to its original form.
